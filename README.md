# Data-Science-Project
Hey,
I have completed this Python Project for Data Science that was a part of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera.</br>
Link for the course : https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science
</br>
</br>
Through this project I have learned about various Libraries like yfinance, pandas, plotly, matplotlib, etc. and I have used them to extract the data of some stocks such as Apple, Tesla, Amd & Gamestop.
I have used web scraping method to extract the data and then displayed what is necessary. In this project, I have used a Python library to obtain financial data and have extracted historical stock data using yfinance.
